# Sustainable Agrochemistry Benchmark (Work in Progress)

This folder will contain a benchmark for sustainable agrochemistry. The benchmark is currently under development and aims to evaluate and compare various approaches and technologies in the field of agrochemistry that prioritize sustainability and environmental protection.

## Project Status

This project is a work in progress. The benchmark and related materials are being developed and will be added to this folder in the future.

## About Agrochemistry

Agrochemistry is a branch of chemistry that focuses on the study and application of chemical processes and products in agriculture. It encompasses a wide range of topics, including the development and use of fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and plant growth controllers to enhance crop production and protect plants from pests and diseases.

## Importance of Sustainable Agrochemistry

Sustainable agrochemistry is crucial for:

1. Enhancing agricultural productivity
2. Ensuring food security
3. Protecting the environment
4. Developing eco-friendly and biodegradable agricultural chemicals
5. Creating sustainable farming systems

## Key Areas of Focus

The benchmark will evaluate technologies and approaches in the following areas:

1. Weed control and plant growth regulators improvement
2. Pesticides development (including insecticides)
3. Fertilizers enhancement

## Future Directions

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is playing an increasingly important role in agrochemicals design and development. AI can offer:

- More accurate prediction of molecule properties related to agrochemistry
- Generation of novel and safe agrochemicals with desired profiles and higher estimated synthesizability
- Design of synthetic routes for new agrochemicals
- Management of the entire agrochemicals DSTA cycle

## Areas of Impact

The benchmark will assess the impact of sustainable agrochemistry approaches on:

1. Crop production
2. Pest and disease control
3. Soil health
4. Environmental protection
5. Animal nutrition
6. Food safety
